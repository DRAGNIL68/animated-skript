Animated-Skript is a model engine designed to be used with Skript Using the Blockbench plugin called Animated-Java.


Animated-java is still in early development it the current version works (1.3.2-alpha) but is more of a rough prototype, i am currently reworking the internals to not resemble blended rubish

features:
- 
- importing custom models into minecraft
- allows models made of block/item displays
- allows models with custom textures (generates resource pack)
- full skript support
