Animated-Skript is a model engine designed to be used with Skript, Using the Blockbench plugin called Animated-Java.
This project has more features than I can remember, but some notable ones of the top of my head are as follows,

- full skript support
- automatic pack generation (stolen from my other project)
- model variants
- multi-animation
- hitboxes

Under the hood this project is not that complex, it uses Jackson for reading Json, Jimfs for the resource pack generation system and bstats for analitics.
